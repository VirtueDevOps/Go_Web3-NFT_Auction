# Web3-NFT_Auction

This script provides a general outline of how someone could create an NFT auction using Go, IPFS, and Ethereum. It includes a struct for representing an NFT, a struct for representing a bid in the auction, and ABI definitions for the NFT contract, the VirtueToken contract, and the auction contract.

Here are some ways in which this script could be helpful or beneficial to someone working in the blockchain space:

As a reference: The script provides a detailed example of how to use Go to create an NFT auction, including how to connect to the Ethereum blockchain, how to deploy and interact with smart contracts, and how to use IPFS for decentralized data storage and retrieval. This could serve as a useful reference for someone who is learning about blockchain development or who is looking for guidance on how to build a similar application.

As a starting point: The script provides a solid foundation that someone could use as a starting point for building their own NFT auction. They could customize the code to suit their specific needs, such as adding additional functionality or integrating with other blockchain platforms.

As a way to understand the inner workings of an NFT auction: By reviewing the code and the comments, someone could gain a deeper understanding of the various components and processes involved in building an NFT auction, such as how bids are accepted and tracked, how the winning bid is determined, and how the NFT is transferred to the winning bidder. This understanding could be valuable for someone working on similar projects or who is interested in the technical aspects of blockchain development.


***Could also be done with Solidity, Javascript or Python. I just wanted to try Go...***
